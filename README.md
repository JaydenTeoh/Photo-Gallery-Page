## Languages & Tools

### HTML

### CSS
  * TailwindCSS for inline-styling

### UI Tools
  * NextJS for building reusable components and introducing state to the app <br />

  
## Approach
 
The task was relatively simple and my solution implements basic React state hooks. The `useState` hook allows me to declare a state variable `imageType` and the value of the variable determines what type of image to show (i.e. 'birds' are represented by 1, 'mountains' by 2 and so on) The image were sourced from the internet and their image links was added to an array. When the state variable is changed, the page re-renders to show a collage of the images. <br />

## Things to work on

1. Learn to use Unsplash API to search images; the images are not restricted to the one saved in my code.
2. Research ways to render images faster on website
